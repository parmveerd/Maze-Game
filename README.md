A maze game created that allows the user to change the difficulty of the maze and play the game. 

The game is created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, where a new maze is automatically generated every playthrough using depth-first search algorithm. The user is able to select through four difficulty levels that will generate a new randomized maze. The game also keeps track of how many steps are taken and will display them at the end so the user knows how they did. 

This contains three files: script.js, style.css, and index.html. The script is used to generate all the game's features, while the html and css are used to create and design the webpage.
